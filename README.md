CoreDataServices is a suite of helper classes to help to remove some of the boilerplate that surrounds using Core Data

##Installation

CoreDataServices is intended to be installed via [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) 

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party in your projects. See the [Getting Started Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build CoreDataServices.

#### Podfile

To integrate CoreDataServices into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

pod 'CoreDataServices'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
